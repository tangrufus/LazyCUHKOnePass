##Workflow
Here’s the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

**Keep this in mind: The `master` branch is for deployment.  _Don't tounch it_.  Leave the hard work to me.  Branch off from the `develop` branch to start your awesome work.  Fetch and rebase the `develop` branch before pusll request. **


1. Fork the project
2. Clone your fork `git clone https://github.com/<yourName>/LazyCUHK.git`
3. Configure remote `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TangRufus/LazyCUHK.git`
4. Create a topic branch,branch off from the develop branch, to contain your change `git checkout -b my_awesome_feature develop`
5. Hack away
6. If necessary, fetch the `develop` branch and rebase your commits into logical chunks, without bugs
7. Push the branch up to your own copy of fork `git push origin my_awesome_feature`
8. Create an Pull Request with a description and link to your branch
